## Layout
The Developer Console is designed to be intuitive and to maximize your space while developing ECP applications. Here are the key areas of the Developer Console.  

- **Editor Controls** - Allows you to quickly save and exit the Developer Console.
- **Application Components** - A complete list of the components that exist in an application.
- **Open Editors &amp Documents** - Controls the main editor area and allows you to quickly switch between open files and documents.
- **Open Tabs List** - Holds a list of all your open tabs, including the tabs that won't fit on the screen.
- **Preview Control** - Allows you to quickly open your application. This also gives you ability to preview any available version.
- **Minimap** - Gives you a quick code outline, useful for jumping between different parts of your file.

## Minimap
A Minimap (code outline) gives you a high level overview of your source code which is very useful for quick navigation and code understanding. A file's minimap is shown on the right side of the editor. You can click or drag the shaded area to quickly jump to different sections of your file.  

The Minimap also acts as a scroll bar. This scroll bar has color coding that highlights errors, warnings, information and find hits. This is very useful when looking for errors in your files.

## Indent Guides
The editor also has vertical lines that assist in visualizing indenting in your code. This helps you code cleaner and faster.

## Command Palette
The Developer Console will provide an exhaustive list of commands in the Command Palette (F1), so you can use the editor without using the mouse. The Command Palette can also be invoked from the editor's context menu.

## Application Components
The Developer Console doesn't work with files. It works with components in an application. This panel gives you quick access to all components of your application. It is structured in the same way an application is structured in ECP. Each section allows you to add a respective component.
