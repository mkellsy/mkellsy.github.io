# Accessibility Guide
This page describes the features the Developer Console has to help make the editor accessible to all users. The Developer Console is a source code editor, intergrated into the Encompass Cloud Platform (ECP).

## Keyboard Navigation
The Developer Console will provide an exhaustive list of commands in the Command Palette (F1), so you can use the editor without using the mouse. The Command Palette can also be invoked from the editor's context menu.

## Screen Readers
The Developer Console supports screen readers in the editor using a strategy based on paging the text.  

The "Go to Next/Previous Error or Warning" actions (F8 and Shift+F8) allow screen readers to announce the error or warning messages. Use Escape or Shift+Escape to return focus to the editor at the position of the error or warning.

When in the editor, and when the suggestions pop up, they will get announced to screen readers. It is possible to navigate the suggestions using Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down (as well as Arrow Up and Arrow Down), you can dismiss the suggestions with Escape or Shift+Escape. These alternative keybindings allow various Screen Reader software to remain in focus mode. If a suggestion has additional details, this will be read out and it is possible to read the additional details by pressing Ctrl+Space.

## Accessibility Help
You can press Alt+F1 to trigger the "Show Accessibility Help" dialog while in the editor to find out the current position in the editor and to check the state of various accessibility options. The editor can be dynamically optimized for screen reader software from this dialog.
